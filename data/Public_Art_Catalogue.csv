Successful with this work, Wright exhibited at venues like the British Crafts Centre, the Design Centre and, in 1957, at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Despite his admiration for Minoan and Cycladic pottery, Wright distanced himself from most contemporary ceramics and looked to a broader picture - to medieval art, African sculpture and artists such as Chagall and Morandi. In 1957 he began teaching at Bath Academy of Art and then at the College of Education (later Bath Spa University College). By the mid-1960s he became frustrated by creative stasis, and moved in a more sculptural direction. He made inventive abstract pieces, notably in porcelain. His underlying themes dealt now with issues of unity and integration, separation and release. By the late 1970s, though still making some pots and producing relief pieces, his activity centred on the small figurative interlocking sculptures for which he is best known.

Extract from www.williampye.com <br>The inscription ''Water is the ultimate life, pure as crystal, the divine influx'' is attributed to the poet Ted Hughes. The quote does not appear to be from one of Hughes’ poem. A clue may lie with an article entitled ‘Poet, Pike and a Pitiful Grouse’ published in the Guardian newspaper on 8 January 1999. It is an interview Ted Hughes gave to an American angling magazine. In one of the paragraph Hughes reflects on the subject of water: ‘Throughout the whole of religious tradition, rivers have been gods. Water has been the soul. And water is the ultimate life […] In Revelation, it issues from under the throne of God, pure as crystal. The divine influx. Somehow we make that connection.

The original plan was an ambitious programme of public art called ‘Cascade’, consisting of water features in five to six different locations across the city (see artist impression in images). A funding application to the Arts Council reached its final stage with success but within two weeks the funding body was re-structured and funding for the full initial project could no longer be secured. The Arts Council agreed to cover feasibility costs but not production costs. The whole programme was scaled down to one project on Bath Street designed by former Turner Prize finalist Vong Phaophanit. Part of the funding was used to involve schools and the local community in art projects. The second setback came in the form of severe delays in the Spa construction timetable and ensuing spiralling costs, causing concern among local residents. Production cost for Phaophanit’s piece in Bath Street was deemed too expensive and the issue too contentious for B&NES Council to finance. But there was still a strong willingness for a piece of public art to feature at the Spa and a donor was sought to sponsor a less complex piece. A local anonymous donor came forth and artist William Pye was chosen to produce ''Divine Influx'' at the Cross Bath.",See also William Pye’s Offspring on Walcot Street and Floating Globe on Broad Street Place.,,290,100,,80,Good,Good,"Thermae Bath Spa Cross Bath, Bath Street, Bath, BA1 1SJ

His sculptures of the 1960s were abstract forms and showed Pye’s preference for the traditional materials of metal and stone. Highly polished geometrical works in stainless steel of the 1970s, some of which included elements of movement, reflection and the use of light, led him logically to consider water as an essential part of his artistic expression. The natural world that he explores in his sculptures is interpreted through water, metal and stone, where disarmingly simple concepts become the objects of utmost sophistication. Early stainless steel sculptures such as Narcissus 1969 and Quillion 1970 are lyrical expressions of form, rhythm, movement and reflection. They both herald William Pye’s move towards using stainless steel in combination with water. The contrast between straight and rolling forms, geometrical and organic are also preludes to everything that emerges later in Pye’s work when water is combined.",http://www.williampye.com,1938,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BA70-a.jpg|BA70-b.jpg|BA70-c.jpg,Copyright: Bath and North East Somerset |Copyright: Bath and North East Somerset |Copyright: Bath and North East Somerset,35,12,7,1,20

Highly polished geometrical works in stainless steel of the 1970s, some of which included elements of movement, reflection and the use of light, led him logically to consider water as an essential part of his artistic expression. The natural world that he explores in his sculptures is interpreted through water, metal and stone, where disarmingly simple concepts become the objects of utmost sophistication. Early stainless steel sculptures such as Narcissus 1969 and Quillion 1970 are lyrical expressions of form, rhythm, movement and reflection.

One pig was raffled.,"King Bladud’s Pigs in Bath was a public art event to celebrate Bath, its origins and its artists - and provide residents and visitors with artistic enjoyment.

Pigs were chosen for Bath in reference to the legend of King Bladud.","Various including paint, mosaic, acorn, bark, synthetic fur, plaster mouldings, metal, glass, etc.","Each pig has a small plaque with the name of the pig, the name of the artist who decorated it and the sponsor.","Local businesses, organisations and individuals sponsored pigs at a cost of £1000 each.  They would choose an artist or a schools department to decorate their pig.  Sponsor and artist jointly decided what the pig was to look like, and gave it a name. There was no direct remuneration for decorating the pigs but the artists were credited on a small plaque on each pig and received publicity for what became a very popular project locally and regionally. The display period ended in September 2008, and on 31st October the pigs were sold by auction. Artists received 25% of the price achieved at the auction. If the pig did not achieve a reserve price of £1,250 the sponsor was to receive the pig and pay  the artist a nominal £250.

This is of a section through a nautilus shell and suggested to me the idea for a vertical sculpture that was a direct development of my ongoing rollwave series.’ William Pye. <br>About rollwave: ‘Water flowing over smooth surfaces creates roll-wave patterning where the thin film of falling water is pulled by surface tension into rhythmical wave patterns. The movement is gentle and relatively subdued, the creeping and rippling water often appearing to dissolve the substance of the structure, rendering it apparently translucent.This aspect is mysterious and captivating, the movement of water apparent from afar.’ Extract from William Pye’s website www.williampye.com",Polished stainless steel,A reflective surface plaque on the ground in front of the piece reads:<br>‘Offspring William Pye 2008’,"Offspring is the first of two pieces for the Walcot Street area by William Pye, part of a programme of regeneration of the area funded by Bath and North East Somerset Council with the Arts Lottery.

His sculptures of the 1960s were abstract forms and showed Pye’s preference for the traditional materials of metal and stone. Highly polished geometrical works in stainless steel of the 1970s, some of which included elements of movement, reflection and the use of light, led him logically to consider water as an essential part of his artistic expression. The natural world that he explores in his sculptures is interpreted through water, metal and stone, where disarmingly simple concepts become the objects of utmost sophistication. Early stainless steel sculptures such as Narcissus 1969 and Quillion 1970 are lyrical expressions of form, rhythm, movement and reflection. They both herald William Pye’s move towards using stainless steel in combination with water. The contrast between straight and rolling forms, geometrical and organic are also preludes to everything that emerges later in Pye’s work when water is combined.",http://www.williampye.com,1938,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BA117-a.jpg|BA117-b.jpg|BA117-c.jpg,Copyright: Bath and North East Somerset |Copyright: Bath and North East Somerset |Copyright: Bath and North East Somerset,35,15,7,1,22

The drawings were made as a way of reflecting on mental distress and the ‘mental health system’. Although originally personal and private, they have become a useful way of communicating thoughts and emotions that are difficult to articulate in words to professionals, friends and family. Many viewers found they could identify or empathise with the subjects explored, especially the hilarity that often helps us to process extreme situations (taken from University of Bath ICIA website).

Bobby told Daniel about the diary drawings but that they were in precious sketchbooks. He suggested photographing the images as though on a kitchen table. After this initial exhibition of 30 images, Bobby went on to expand the body of exhibitable works to 159 pieces, exhibited at the Wellcome collection in 2009.

She found that the best way of presenting these edible works of art to the public was through performance. In 1980 she had the first of her two children and in 1988 she first presented ‘Drawing on a Mother''s Experience’ telling the story of the intervening years and marking her come-back to performance art. Many new productions followed. ‘Cook Dems’ in 1990, the ‘Daily Life Series’ in 1991. In ‘Kitchen Show’, the first of the series, she opened her London kitchen to the public sharing with them her own domestic rituals. ‘How To Shop’ followed in July 1993, and took the form of a lecture on the art of supermarket shopping. ‘Take a Peek!’ was a fun fair where the grotesqueries of the stalls and side shows form Bobby Baker''s inimitable interpretation of the hilarities and humiliations, the sufferings and surrealism of a visit to the health centre. In Spring 2002, Baker began development of two new projects about the human mind ‘Voices Hearing’ and How to Live’, the latter became a production that premiered at the Barbican Theatre in November 2004 and toured the UK, including ICIA Arts Theatre at the University of Bath. Following an AHRC Creative Fellowship in the English and Drama Department Bobby Baker was awarded an Honorary Doctorate at Queen Mary College, University of London.

In this context the story of creation in Genesis is a metaphor for the creativity in thought, mind and spirit that should be at the heart of a university''s search for truth.<br>Sea: in Christian and Jewish imagery water is often a symbol for chaos or disorder in creation. When the Spirit of God is portrayed as brooding ""upon the face of the deep"" and bringing harmony to confusion in the Genesis creation story, then it is a symbol of the human quest for knowledge in which a university is a crucial part.<br>Spirit: the Holy Spirit is depicted by many different symbols including fire, wind and a dove. Amongst other things, the imagery of the bird and its wings stands for the freedom - the freedom of God in creation and the freedom of humanity to respond to that divine act of love.<br>Trinity: at the heart of the triptych is the symbol of the Trinity signifying that God is, of essence, relational.

He returns time and time again to favourite subjects; the auricula paintings, red currants, flowerpots and snowdrops.",http://www.johnmorley.info/,1942,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BA97-a.jpg,Copyright: Bath and North East Somerset,22,580,12,1,29

By placing a pinhole camera on a lab bench for a very long exposure, the artist captured the chance elements, such as traces of human activity, in a clinical space. Rather than the clear subject/object relationship experienced in a scientific environment, Deborah uses artistic methods involving chance and changing viewpoints to record elements of the space. Through the poignant beauty of the light reflected by the lab''s many surfaces, she suggests absence and loss, and raises the spectre of the inexplicable (taken from University of Bath ICIA website).
