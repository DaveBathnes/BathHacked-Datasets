By accessing the database, various information (including Name of Operator, Operator Site Ref., Station Type, Height of Antenna, Frequency range, Transmitter power, Maximum licensed power, Type of Transmission) is displayed in relation to a particular mobile phone base station in the searched location. That information is based on the underlying dataset provided to Ofcom by the contributing operators. Ofcom makes no corrections to the data supplied by the operators and therefore Ofcom cannot accept liability for any inaccuracies or omissions in the data provided within Sitefinder, or its currency.
This Excel spreadsheet contains information from the underlying datasets used by Ofcom in the last update of Sitefinder in May 2012, which information includes grid reference information that is not displayed in Sitefinder. However, it should be noted that some information contained in this spreadsheet will be out-of-date. This is because, in particular, T-Mobile (since 2005), Orange (since 2010) and Airwave (since 2010) have decided to suspend participation and in consequence, data has not been updated. The last update in May 2012 (as reflected in this spreadsheet) is based on the following datasets received by Ofcom: O2 (May 2012), Network Rail (April 2012), Hutchison (February 2012), Vodafone (October 2011), Airwave (February 2010), Orange (February 2010) and T-Mobile (August 2005).
The information in this spreadsheet may therefore contain inaccuracies or omissions, particularly when compared with current network deployment, for the same reasons explained above."
